Text Input Problem
########################

In text input problems, learners enter text into a response field. The response
can include numbers, letters, and special characters such as punctuation marks.
The text that the learner enters must match the specified answer exactly,
including spelling and punctuation, to be marked correct. As a result, edX
recommends that you specify more than one correct answer for text input
problems to allow for differences in capitalization and typographical errors.

For the text input problems in your course, you can use edX Insights to review
aggregated learner performance data and examine submitted answers. For more
information, see `Using edX Insights`_.

******************************
Creating a Text Input Problem
******************************

You can create text input problems in the Simple Editor or in the Advanced
Editor. You can set up a problem in the Simple Editor, and then switch to the
Advanced Editor to add more configuration options in XML. However, you cannot
switch back to the Simple Editor from the Advanced Editor. Therefore, you
might want to format the problem as completely as possible before you begin to
use the Advanced Editor.

.. _Use the Simple Editor to Create a Text Input Problem:

========================================================================
Use the Simple Editor to Create a Text Input Problem
========================================================================

To use the :ref:`Simple Editor<Simple Editor>` to create a text input problem,
follow these steps.

#. In the unit where you want to create the problem, under **Add New
   Component** select **Problem**.
#. From the list of **Common Problem Types**, select **Text Input**. Studio
   adds an example text input problem to the unit.
#. Select **Edit**. The Simple Editor opens.
#. Replace the sample problem text with your own text.
#. Determine the text that describes the question you want learners to answer,
   and surround that text with two pairs of angle brackets (``>>question<<``).
   This question text is the accessible label for the problem.
#. Select the text of the problem's answer, and then select **Text Input** from 
   the toolbar. An equals signe (=) appears next to the answer.

   You can identfy more than one correct answer. For more information, see
   :ref:`Multiple Responses in Text Input Problems`.

7. To provide an explanation, select the explanation text and then select 
   **Explanation** from the toolbar. ``[explanation]`` appears before
   and after the explanation text.
#. Select **Settings** and provide an identifying **Display Name** for the
   problem.
#. Define additional settings for the problem. For more information, see
   :ref:`Problem Settings`.
#. Select **Save**.

For the example problem illustrated above, the following text displays in the
problem component.


::

    >>What is the technical term that refers to the fact that, when enough people 
    sleep under a bednet, the disease may altogether disappear?<<
    = herd immunity

    [explanation]
    The correct answer is herd immunity. As more and more people use bednets, 
    the risk of malaria begins to fall for everyone – users and non-users alike. 
    This can fall to such a low probability that malaria is effectively eradicated 
    from the group (even when the group does not have 100% bednet coverage).
    [explanation]


========================================================================
Use the Advanced Editor to Edit a Text Input Problem 
========================================================================

To use the Advanced Editor to edit a text input problem, follow these steps.

#. Follow the steps for creating the problem in the :ref:`Simple Editor<Use
   the Simple Editor to Create a Text Input Problem>`. 
#. Select **Advanced Editor**, and then edit the XML to add the tags and
   attributes you want. An example follows.

**Problem Code**:

  <problem>
  <p>
    <em>This problem is adapted from an exercise that first appeared in MITx's 14.73x The Challenges of Global Poverty course, spring 2013.</em>
  </p>
  <p>What is the technical term that refers to the fact that, when enough people sleep under a bednet, the disease may altogether disappear?</p>
  <stringresponse answer="herd immunity" type="ci regexp">
         <additional_answer>community immunity</additional_answer>
          <additional_answer>population immunity</additional_answer>

              <hintpart on="contact_immunity_hint">
                  <startouttext />
                  In contact immunity, a vaccinated individual passes along his immunity to another person through contact with feces or bodily fluids. The answer to the question above refers to the form of immunity that occurs when so many members of a population are protected, an infectious disease is unlikely to spread to the unprotected population.
                  <endouttext />
              </hintpart >

              <hintpart on="firewall_immunity_hint">
                  <startouttext />
                  Although a firewall provides protection for a population, the term "firewall" is used more in computing and technology than in epidemiology.
                  <endouttext />

.. _Multiple Responses in Text Input Problems:

******************************************
Multiple Responses in Text Input Problems
******************************************

You can specify more than one correct response for text input problems. For
example, instead of requiring learners to enter "Dr. Martin Luther King,
Junior" exactly, you can also allow answers of "Martin Luther King," "Doctor
Martin Luther King," and other variations. To do this, you can use the Simple
Editor or the Advanced Editor.

==============
Simple Editor
==============

To specify additional correct responses in the Simple Editor, include``or= ``
before each additional correct response.

::

    >>What African-American led the United States civil rights movement during the 1960s?<<
    = Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
    or= Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior
    or= Martin Luther King, Jr.
    or= Martin Luther King

=====================
Advanced Editor
=====================

To specify additional correct responses in the Advanced Editor, add an
``<additional_answer>`` for each correct response inside the opening and
closing ``<stringresponse>`` tags.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>

  <p>What African-American led the United States civil rights movement during the 1960s?</p>
    
  <stringresponse answer="Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr." type="ci" >
    <additional_answer>Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior</additional_answer>
    <additional_answer>Martin Luther King, Jr.</additional_answer>
    <additional_answer>Martin Luther King</additional_answer>
    <textline label="What African-American led the United States civil rights movement during the 1960s?" size="20"/>
  </stringresponse>

  </problem>

******************************************
Case Sensitivity and Text Input Problems
******************************************

By default, text input problems do not require a case sensitive response. You
can change this and require a case sensitive answer.

To make a text input response case sensitive, you must use :ref:`Advanced
Editor`.

In the Advanced Editor, you see that the ``type`` attribute of the
``stringresponse`` element equals ``ci``, for "case insensitive". An example
follows.

::

    <stringresponse answer="Michigan" type="ci">
      <textline size="20"/>
    </stringresponse>

To make the response case sensitive, change the value of the ``type``
attribute to ``cs``.

::

    <stringresponse answer="Michigan" type="cs">
      <textline size="20"/>
    </stringresponse>

*************************************************
Response Field Length of Text Input Problems
*************************************************

By default, the response field for text input problems is 20 characters long.

You should preview the unit to ensure that the length of the response input
field accommodates the correct answer, and provides extra space for possible
incorrect answers.

If the default response field length is not sufficient, you can change it
using :ref:`Advanced Editor`.

In the Advanced Editor, in the XML block for the answer, you see that the
``size`` attribute of the ``textline`` element equals ``20``.

::

    <stringresponse answer="Democratic Republic of the Congo" type="ci">
      <textline size="20"/>
    </stringresponse>

To change the response field length, change the value of the ``size``
attribute.

::

    <stringresponse answer="Democratic Republic of the Congo" type="ci">
      <textline size="40"/>
    </stringresponse>

********************************************************
Hints and Regular Expressions in Text Input Problems
********************************************************

You can provide hints that appear when learners enter common incorrect answers
in text input problems. You can also set a text input problem to allow a
regular expression as an answer. To do this, you modify the problem's XML in
the Advanced Editor.

The regular expression that the learner enters must contain the part of the
answer that the course team specifies. For example, if you 
specify  ``<answer="example answer" type="regexp">``, correct answers
include ``example answered``, ``two example answers``, or even ``==example
answer==``, but not ``examples`` or ``example anser``.

You can add ``regexp`` to the value of the ``type`` attribute, for example:
``type="ci regexp"`` or ``type="regexp"`` or ``type="regexp cs"``. In this
case, any answers or hints are treated as regular expressions.
